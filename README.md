# Negative Feedback Amplifier Analysis

## Overview
This repository contains the analysis and implementation of a voltage amplifier with shunt sampling-series mixing negative feedback configuration. The laboratory explores how varying feedback parameters affects amplifier characteristics including midband voltage gain (AVM), input resistance (Ri), output resistance (Ro), and bandwidth (fH).

## Circuit Description
The circuit implements a voltage amplifier with negative feedback to improve stability, linearity, and reduce distortion. Key components include:
- Adjustable resistors R1 and R2 for varying feedback ratio (β)
- Capacitor C1 to control bandwidth
- A 100K Ohm series resistor at the output to facilitate output resistance measurements

## Experimental Setup
- Initial configuration: R1 = 1K, R2 = 100K
- 10 Ohm voltage divider at function generator output to prevent waveform clipping
- Load resistance: oscilloscope input resistance (considered as "open circuit")

## Measurements
The laboratory involves:
1. Computing feedback ratio β and estimating midband voltage gain
2. Measuring input resistance, output resistance, and bandwidth
3. Comparing theoretical estimates with actual measurements

## Objectives
- Investigate effects of negative feedback on amplifier performance
- Understand the relationship between feedback ratio and amplifier characteristics
- Demonstrate practical applications of negative feedback in electronic design

## Results
The experiment demonstrates how negative feedback effectively modifies amplifier characteristics, improving performance in terms of stability and linearity.
